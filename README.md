## Pre-requisites

You must know how to:

- use `input()` to get user input.
- convert string to integer using `int()`
- use `print()` to print output
- create loop with `for` and `range`

## Instructions

### Split VS Code Window

You can drag `main.py` tab to the right side of the window to split the window into two panes. This will allow you to see the instructions and the code at the same time.

### Answering

You can answer the questions by writing your answers in the `main.py` file.

You can run the code by clicking the `Run` button on the top right corner of the editor.

The output will be shown in the `Terminal` tab at the bottom of the editor.

## Your Task

**DO NOT** add prompt message in `input()` when you are submitting.
